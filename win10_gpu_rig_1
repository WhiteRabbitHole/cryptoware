Here is how i tweak my windows for a mining rig!

WINDOWS INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION FOR MINING RIG
Important:

Do not plug the Ethernet cable to your mining rig while windows installation or after that
Plug only ONE GPU in the PCI Express 16x slot with usb riser
I have always used 120GB SSD drives (you can use bigger, there is no restriction)
Always used just one partition C: 

WINDOWS VERSION FOR MINING RIG:
- Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit

MOTHERBOARD AND BIOS
Depending on what motherboard you will be using, some of them needs some BIOS modifications 
to make it work properly with USB Risers or anything else. 
For this, i will take as example “Z270A  Pro ” (https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/Z270-A-PRO.html)


FLASHING THE MOTHERBOARD WITH THE OFFICIAL 1.7 BIOS PATCH
- First of all, you’d need to download the latest official firmware upgrade from here:
https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/Z270-A-PRO#down-bios
https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/Z270-A-PRO#down-driver&Win10%2064
-  Unzip it into the root of a USB drive.
- Unplug all the GPUs from the board and leave only the HDMI cable and the USB drive plugged into it, as well as the keyboard/mouse.
-  Once you turn the PC on, go to the BIOS and press F7 for advanced settings. Once there, go to M-Flash (bottom left side of the screen); you will be asked to confirm whether you want the system to reboot and enter Flash mode. Click on yes and wait for the system to reboot.
-  You will see an M-Flash screen that will ask you to choose the file containing the firmware. Locate it in your pen drive (File name: E7A12IMS.170), select it and confirm selection.
- After you do that, wait for the BIOS to update.
- Now, go to the BIOS, Settings -> Advanced -> PCI Subsystem Settings
Change ‘PEG0’ and ‘PEG1’ values to ‘Gen1’
Set ‘Above 4G Decoding’ to ‘Enabled’

- That’s all you have to do. Leave the other settings unchanged; save the settings and plug in the extended USB risers 
and the HDMI cable to the graphics card.
- You’re all set now. Verify whether your mining software detects all your GPUs. 
If it doesn’t then you might try the second unofficial method of patching your motherboard.

WINDOWS 10 REGISTRY TWEAKS FOR MINING
- Once windows is full installed and booted for the first time i always run the Windows 10 Registry tweaks for mining.bat file 
https://mega.nz/#!8gZzjQaa!Dt4wE0WEo8nZkui_-cAAXL4mb4YlO6CJgFZTXKq9pnQ 
(i am not disabling everything, just things that i think wont be needed, windows update, cortana, crash reports etc..)
- Back Up Your Registry or create a restore point
- Run in administrator mode
- Once everything is applied, restart the rig

List of Tweaks:
Replace Utilman with CMD
Disable Cortana, Bing Search and Searchbar
Disable automatic Windows Updates
Disable Hibernation
Disable tracking services
Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service
Disable Windows Search
Disable Superfetch
Disable Windows Defender
Disable OneDrive
Disable Quick Access as default view in Explorer
show computer shortcut on desktop
Show file extensions
Disable lockscreen
Enable classic control panel view
Hide indication for compressed NTFS files
Disable Windows Update sharing
Remove Pin to start
Classic vertical icon spacing
Remove versioning tab from properties
Disable jump lists
Remove telemetry and data collection
Change Logon screen background with accent color
Disable Windows Error Reporting
Removing Windows default apps
Blocking Telemetry Servers

STOP WINDOWS UPDATE #DOUBLECHECK
- In RUN type “services.msc“, the services page will be open
- Search for “Windows Update“
- Click “Stop” if status is “Live” or “Checking/Running“
- Select “Disabled” on “Startup type“
- Apply & Restart
- Do it again and make sure that it is disabled
- Also if you want you can disable more services..

- Combined AMD Drivers ( AMD Drivers 17.5.2 Non-WHQL-Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-ReLive-17.5.2-May17 & AMD Drivers 16.11.5 Non-WHQL-Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-16.11.5-Nov25)
- AMD/ATI Pixel Clock Patcher (https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-AMD-ATI-Pixel-Clock-Patcher)
- ATIFlash 2.74 (https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ati-atiflash/)
- GPU-Z (https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/)
- Claymore.s.Dual.Ethereum.Decred_Siacoin_Lbry_Pascal.AMD.NVIDIA.GPU.Miner.v10.0 
- TeamViever 13
- Wireshark
- stratum proxy

1. Clean PC from previous Drivers
Run DDU and select to uninstall current drivers in safe mode
2. Extract Drivers
Run 17.5.2 driver file and extract the files, skip the installation
Run 16.11.5 driver file and extract the files, skip the installation

3. Copy drivers
Once extracted both driver versions, go to extracted files of driver version 16.11.5 C:\AMD\Non-WHQL-Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-16.11.5-Nov25\Packages\Drivers\Display\WT6A_INF\B309089 and copy everything
Then go to driver version 17.5.2 C:\AMD\Non-WHQL-Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-ReLive-17.5.2-May17\Packages\Drivers\Display\WT6A_INF\B314330 and paste the files that you just copied from 16.11.5

4. Installing mixed drivers
Go to “Device Manager“
Right click on any GPU from “Display Adapter” tab then click on “Update Driver Software“
Choose “Browse my computer for driver software“
Select the WTA6A_INF folder from 17.5.2 driver version “C:\AMD\Non-WHQL-Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-ReLive-17.5.2-May17\Packages\Drivers\Display\WT6A_INF” and click “Next“
Wait for a few seconds to install the driver
If you get a Windows security warning just click on “Install this drivers software anyway

!!!DON'T RESTART!!!

5. Apply the patch: AMD/ATI Pixel Clock Patcher

IMPORTANT: Before starting to make any bios modification, install and combine AMD Drivers and do not restart, start atikmdag-patcher.exe and apply the patch (if needed), 
after this you can restart the pc. If you don’t this the GPUs wont work with the new modded bios flashed.

6.  GPU BIOS mod/flash & tools
- Backup/Save original Default BIOS:
 Shut down your rig
 Remove all the GPUs and leave only one plugged, my recommendation is to flash the cards one by one
 Start the rig and Extract ATIFlash 2.74 to C: in a folder like “atiflash“
 Run ATIWinflash.exe as administrator, click on “Save” button to save the default BIOS (make sure the RX 580 card is selected), give it a name like Sapphire580defaultBIOS.rom
 Click “ok” and “continue“
 Once the BIOS is saved close ATIFlash

- Silent BIOS switch:
 Shutdown your rig again
 Switch BIOS to silent mode (towards the HDMI cable side)
 Start the rig
 Backup “Silent” BIOS 
 Save original Silent BIOS
 Open ATIWinflash.exe as administrator
 Save the BIOS again, this time give it a name like Sapphire580silentBIOS.rom

- Download BIOS (Important, this BIOS is for Hynix memory only! Check your memory with GPUz software)
 (https://mega.nz/540b41de-bf1e-4765-bb6d-71433b517cac - SapphireRX580+Nitro(Hynix)MOD.rom)

- Flash the BIOS with ATIFlash 2.74

  VERY IMPORTANT: Always extract ATIflash to C:/atiflash folder and place the ROM file that needs to be flashed in the same directory

 Start ATIFlash 2.74
 Load the image SapphireRX580+Nitro(Hynix)MOD.rom
 Click on “Program” button
 Wait about 30-60 seconds till you get the message “Your VBIOS was programmed successfully“, click OK
 Restart the rig and test

- Claymore 10.0 + underclock + undervolt
Download and extract Claymore miner
Right click on start.bat fileand click “Edit“
Paste the following code:

setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0
setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100
setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1
setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100

Hi again guys!
I was working around to figure out how to make this new beta driver (one with "DAG issue" fix) work stable, 
run without memory controller errors, use less power and keep temp on ~50 degrees. And finally I've found sweet spot :)

THIS IS ONLY FOR BETA DRIVER!
THIS IS ONLY FOR HYNIX MEMORY!

256 kb ROM:
https://mega.nz/#!43xRHaaa!...

512 kb ROM:
https://mega.nz/#!5uwFBASK!...

Only difference from my previous rom is lower clocks - 1100/2100 (prev. 1150/2150). 
Yeah, this is the only way... (that I've found after 48 hours testing...).

PLEASE NOTICE! DO NOT MODIFY CLOCKS IN MSI AB OR VIA MINER!

Target clocks and voltage need to be flashed in bios. 
This is because when you set clocks to any other values than stored in bios using MSI Afterburner (4.4.0 beta 15 works fine with beta driver) or via miner, 
driver will reset voltage settings to defaults. 
So you'll get power consumption on GPU = 135-140W (from wall = even higher), and temp about 65 degrees. Beta driver, so...

Results with 6 GPU rig (ETH-Only mode):
178 mH/s
~90w on GPU
0 memory controller errors
~2.5 shares/minute (ethermine.org)

To say the true, although hashrate is 178, final outcome is the same to prev., 
when I was using official driver and set 1200/2200 clocks for core and mem, and had 175 mH/s on 137 epoch. 
It was about 2.5 shares per minute....

If any of you guys figure out how to get better results, please, share with others.
