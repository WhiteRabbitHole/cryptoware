PROBLEMS AND FIXES

I will update this list with more problems and solutions.

- GPU reached STOP temperature and Fan Speed 0% 
log: 10:59:14:114	dc0	GPU #0 reached STOP temperature (85 >= 85), stop mining on this GPU.	
                  f90	GPU 0 mining was stopped because -tstop temperature reached.
stats: GPU0 t=82C  fan=0%
Open Sapphire TRIXX and do fan check
Restart OS
Check log and claymore statistics

- GPU not recognized by atiflash
Uninstall drivers with latest version of DDU in safe mode.
Install latest mining edition drivers
Download latest Atiflash 2.77 and try again
Also try to backup via CMD and apply the patch

- Exclamation mark in device manager after rig reboot
Apply the patch and restart

- Flashing BIOS error message
If you get that while trying to flash the bios via atiflash gui, try again via CMD with –f –p
If you still get the same error message switch BIOS jumpers to the other side and try again (you can do it without restarting the rig)

- Empty Backup BIOS – 0 KB BIOS Size
For some reason, the silent BIOS version that was saved by atiflash resulted in a 0 KB file. I was able to backup it with GPUz and getting a full-sized back-up with a size of 256 KB. You can also try to backup via CMD using –s command (I missed that)

- Claymore no AMD or CUDA GPU detected
Apply the patch and restart the rig
